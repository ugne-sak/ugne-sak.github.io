#### Denoising Representation Learning for Causal Discovery (Master's Thesis)
*@ Learning & Adaptive Systems Group at the Department of Computer Science of ETH Zürich*

*Supervisors: Prof. Sebastian Engelke, Prof. Bernhard Schölkopf, Lars Lorch*

Discovering a causal structure underlying the variables in a system is an important task in many scientific disciplines. Most of the methods for causal structure learning operate under the assumption that observed data is an accurate reflection of the true interactions among the variables in a data-generating mechanism. However, observations in real-world datasets often contain noise and measurement error inherent to the data collection process, distorting the signal of the true dependencies. To mitigate the effect of such technical noise, we propose a principled approach for inferring the distribution of the unobservable signal from its noisy measurements by learning an *amortized variational denoising model*.
